## Request your own USRBG
* Join this Discord Server > [Black Box](https://discord.gg/TeRQEPb), Upload your file directly into the channel. [#background-request](https://discord.com/channels/449175561529589761/645627516794699787/) and wait for approval.

**All requests are processed manually** by a select few theme developers (as of right now). You should expect to **wait a short amount of time before** your background **is added.**


## Requirements
If you are using BetterDiscord, you **MUST have [Data Attributes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ItMeSarah/BD-Addons/main/plugins/DataAttributes/DataAttributes.plugin.js)** for certain important data attributes.

### 1. Importing the Database

```css
@import "https://github.com/ItMeSarah/BD-Addons/blob/main/usrbg/usrbg.css";
```

This will import the USRBG database. Alone, it's simply some variables. Some of examples on how it can be utilized can be seen in the [usrbg](UsrBGSnippet.css) folder of this repo.
